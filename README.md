# LABIR

## Introduction 
Labir is an Arduino 8x8 matrix game, created for the course " Introduction to robotics ".Labir is a Labyrinth and obviously the goal of the game is to find the exit of the Labyrinth. 

## Electronic Components
1. Arduino UNO R3 board
2. Max7219 driver
3. LED matrix 8x8 1088AS
4. LCD 1602 Module
5. Joystick
6. Button
7. Mini Breadboard
8. Breadboard
9. 10k ohm potentiometer
10. 10 mF capacitor
11. 104 pF capacitor
12. 10k ohm resistor
13. 220 ohm resistor

## The game
In Labir there are three different level (easy, medium, difficult) with different labyrinth. In each level the fixed red points rappresents the wall of the labyrith, the player corresponds to a flashing red point of the matrix, and another flashing red point is the exit. You can move the red point of the player with the joystick and reach the exit. The LCD display shows you how you can do to play the game and how you can play again if you win or lose (if you press the bottom you can play the game) and how many moves you have to reach the exit in each level. After he easy level you will find one or more false flashing red points, these false points serve to increase the difficulty of the game and if the player goes on one of these points he will restart in the initial position. Attached in this document you find a video of the game.
